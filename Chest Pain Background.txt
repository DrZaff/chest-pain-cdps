Chest Pain: Scope and Clinical Importance

##Epidemiology and Health Care Utilization
  Chest pain is the second most common emergency department (ED) presentation among U.S.
  adults, accounting for >6.5 million ED visits annually (4.7% of all ED visits).¹

  Chest pain also results in nearly 4 million outpatient visits per year in the United States.²
  
  Although chest pain is frequently noncardiac in origin, it requires careful evaluation due to the
  prevalence and potential severity of coronary disease.

##Coronary Disease Context
  Coronary artery disease (CAD) affects >18.2 million U.S. adults and remains the leading cause of
  death in both men and women, with >365,000 deaths annually.³

  Chest pain is the most common presenting symptom of CAD in both sexes.

##Diagnostic Challenge
  The lifetime prevalence of chest pain in the United States is 20–40%.⁴
  Women experience chest pain more frequently than men.⁵

  Among ED patients presenting with chest pain:
    Only ~5.1% are diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).⁶
    >50% are ultimately found to have a noncardiac cause.⁶

##Clinical Implication
  Differentiating serious cardiac etiologies from benign causes is essential, given the low
  prevalence of ACS but the high mortality burden associated with CAD.¹–⁶
