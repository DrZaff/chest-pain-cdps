### **Chest Pain: Scope and Clinical Importance**

* Chest pain is the **second most common ED presentation** in U.S. adults, accounting for **>6.5 million ED visits annually** (4.7% of all ED visits)¹.
* It also results in **nearly 4 million outpatient visits per year** in the United States².
* Despite often being **noncardiac**, chest pain requires careful evaluation due to the prevalence and severity of coronary disease.

### **Coronary Disease Context**

* **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** affects **>18.2 million U.S. adults** and remains the **leading cause of death** in both men and women, with **>365,000 deaths annually**³.
* Chest pain is the **most common presenting symptom of CAD** in both sexes.

---

### **Diagnostic Challenge**

* Lifetime prevalence of chest pain in the U.S. is **20–40%**⁴.
* **Women experience chest pain more frequently than men**⁵.
* Among ED patients presenting with chest pain:

  * Only **~5.1%** are diagnosed with **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**⁶.
  * **>50%** ultimately have a **noncardiac cause**⁶.

### **Clinical Implication**

* Differentiating **serious cardiac causes** from **benign etiologies** is essential, given the **low ACS prevalence** but **high mortality burden** of CAD¹–⁶.
