Contraindications by Imaging Modality

##Exercise ECG
  Contraindicated or Not Appropriate When:
    Abnormal resting ECG limiting interpretation:
    Left bundle branch block

    Parkinson-White pattern
    Unable to achieve ≥5 METs or unsafe to exercise
    High-risk or active ischemia:
      High-risk unstable angina
      Active ACS or AMI (<2 days)
    Uncontrolled cardiac conditions:
    Heart failure
    Significant arrhythmias (VT, complete AV block, high-risk QT-related arrhythmias)
    Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
    Severe systemic arterial hypertension (≈ ≥200/110 mm Hg)
    Acute systemic illness:
      Acute PE
      Acute myocarditis/pericarditis
      Acute aortic dissection

##Stress Nuclear Imaging (SPECT / PET)
  Contraindicated or Not Appropriate When:
    High-risk unstable angina or complicated ACS / AMI (<2 days)
    Contraindications to vasodilator stress:
      Significant arrhythmias (VT, advanced AV block)
      Sinus bradycardia (<45 bpm)
      Hypotension (SBP <90 mm Hg)
      Known or suspected bronchoconstrictive or bronchospastic disease
      Recent use of dipyridamole or dipyridamole-containing medications
      Recent methylxanthine use (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline within 12 h)
      Known hypersensitivity to adenosine or regadenoson
      Severe systemic arterial hypertension (≈ ≥200/110 mm Hg)

##Stress Echocardiography
  Contraindicated or Limited When:
    Poor acoustic windows (e.g., COPD, obesity)
    Inability to reach target heart rate
    Uncontrolled heart failure
    High-risk unstable angina or active ACS / AMI (<2 days)
    Serious ventricular arrhythmias or high-risk QT prolongation
    Significant respiratory failure:
      Severe COPD
      Acute pulmonary embolism
      Severe pulmonary hypertension
    Critical aortic stenosis
    Acute illnesses:
      Acute PE
      Acute myocarditis/pericarditis
      Acute aortic dissection
    Hemodynamically significant LV outflow tract obstruction
    Contraindications to atropine:
      Narrow-angle glaucoma
      Myasthenia gravis
      Obstructive uropathy
      Obstructive gastrointestinal disorders
    Severe systemic arterial hypertension (≈ ≥200/110 mm Hg)
    Contrast-Specific Contraindications:
      Hypersensitivity to perflutren
      Hypersensitivity to blood products or albumin (Optison only)

##Stress Cardiac MRI (CMR)
  Contraindicated or Limited When:
    Reduced renal function (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²)
    Contraindications to vasodilator stress
    Implanted devices not MRI-safe or causing major artifact
    Significant claustrophobia
    Caffeine ingestion within past 12 hours

##Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)
  Contraindicated or Limited When:
    Allergy to iodinated contrast
    Inability to cooperate with scan or breath-hold instructions
    Clinical instability:
      Acute respiratory distress
      Severe hypotension
      Unstable arrhythmia
      Renal impairment per institutional protocol
      Inability to achieve adequate heart rate control:
      Contraindication to beta-blockers
      No alternative rate-control agents available
      Significant heart rate variability or arrhythmia
      Contraindication to nitroglycerin (if required for protocol)

##Global Imaging Considerations
  Inability to obtain diagnostic image quality should prompt alternative testing, especially in obese patients
  Pregnancy screening should follow institutional radiation-safety policies
  Low-dose dobutamine may be useful for assessing low-gradient aortic stenosis
