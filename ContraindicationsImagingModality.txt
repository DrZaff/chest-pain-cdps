# Contraindications by Imaging Modality
::content::
## Exercise ECG
- Abnormal resting ECG (LBBB, paced rhythm, WPW)
- Inability to exercise ≥5 METs
- Active ischemia or ACS (<2 days)
- Uncontrolled cardiac conditions
- Severe aortic stenosis or hypertension
- Acute systemic illness (PE, myocarditis, dissection)

## Stress Nuclear Imaging (SPECT / PET)
- High-risk ACS
- Vasodilator contraindications (arrhythmias, hypotension, bronchospasm, caffeine)
- Severe hypertension

## Stress Echocardiography
- Poor acoustic windows
- Uncontrolled HF or arrhythmias
- Acute systemic illness
- Atropine contraindications
- Contrast hypersensitivity

## Stress Cardiac MRI
- eGFR <30
- MRI-incompatible devices
- Claustrophobia
- Recent caffeine

## Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)
- Iodinated contrast allergy
- Clinical instability
- Renal impairment
- Inability to control heart rate

## Global Imaging Considerations
- Diagnostic image quality
- Pregnancy screening
- Low-dose dobutamine use
