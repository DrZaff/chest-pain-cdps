- Avoid term 'atypical chest pain'
- Classify as cardiac, possibly cardiac, noncardiac

## Initial Evaluation
- Focused history and physical
- Special attention to women and older adults
- Cultural and language considerations

## Diagnostic Testing
- ECG within 10 minutes
- Troponin testing ASAP
- Avoid delayed ED transfer

## ECG
- Serial ECGs if nondiagnostic
- Treat per STEMI/NSTE-ACS guidelines

## Biomarkers
- Serial troponins
- hs-cTn preferred

## Acute Chest Pain With Suspected ACS
- Use clinical decision pathways
- Risk stratify (low, intermediate, high)

## Low-Risk Patients
- <1% 30-day MACE → discharge without testing

## Intermediate-Risk Patients
- TTE for bedside assessment
- Observation unit reasonable

## Diagnostic Testing in No Known CAD
- CCTA or stress testing
