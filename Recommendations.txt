# ACC/AHA Chest Pain Guideline — Key Recommendations

---

## **1.4.2. Defining Chest Pain**

**Initial triage**

* Use early assessment of chest pain to triage patients based on likelihood of myocardial ischemia¹–⁷
  **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

**Terminology**

* Avoid the term *“atypical chest pain”*
* Describe symptoms as:

  * **Cardiac**
  * **Possibly cardiac**
  * **Noncardiac**
    These terms are more specific and reduce misclassification¹–⁷
    **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

---

## **2. Initial Evaluation**

### **2.1. History**

* Obtain a **focused history** that includes:

  * Symptom characteristics
  * Symptom duration
  * Associated features
  * Cardiovascular risk factors
    **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

---

### **2.1.1. Focus on the Uniqueness of Chest Pain in Women**

* Women presenting with chest pain are at risk for **underdiagnosis**; cardiac causes should **always be considered**¹–⁷
  **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

* History in women should emphasize **accompanying symptoms** more common in ACS (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, nausea)¹–⁷
  **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

---

### **2.1.2. Considerations for Older Patients With Chest Pain**

* In patients **>75 years**, consider ACS when chest pain is accompanied by:

  * Shortness of breath
  * Syncope
  * Acute delirium
  * Unexplained fall
    **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

---

### **2.1.3. Considerations for Diverse Patient Populations**

* Use **cultural competency training** to improve outcomes in patients from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

* When English is not a patient’s primary language, use **formal medical translation services** to address language barriers
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

---

### **2.1.4. Patient-Centric Considerations**

* For **acute chest pain**, patients or bystanders should activate **9-1-1** to initiate EMS transport to the nearest ED
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

---

## **2.2. Physical Examination**

* Perform an **initial focused cardiovascular examination** to:

  * Aid in diagnosis of ACS
  * Identify other life-threatening causes (e.g., aortic dissection, PE, esophageal rupture)
  * Detect complications
    **(COR 1, LOE C-EO)**

---

## **2.3. Diagnostic Testing**

### **2.3.1. Setting Considerations**

* If no clear noncardiac cause is evident, obtain an **ECG** for patients with stable chest pain seen in office settings; refer to the ED if ECG is unavailable¹–⁵
  **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

* Patients with suspected ACS or other life-threatening causes in the office setting should be **urgently transported to the ED**, ideally by EMS¹–⁹
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

* In **all settings**, obtain and review an ECG within **10 minutes** of arrival for patients with acute chest pain¹,³,⁶,⁷,¹⁰
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

* Measure **cardiac troponin (cTn)** as soon as possible after ED presentation in suspected ACS⁸,⁹
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

* **Avoid delayed ED transfer** for patients with suspected ACS initially evaluated in outpatient settings when diagnostic testing (e.g., cTn) is required
  **(COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD)**

---

### **2.3.2. Electrocardiogram**

* If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, perform **serial ECGs** to detect ischemic changes, especially when:

  * Clinical suspicion for ACS is high
  * Symptoms persist
  * Clinical status worsens¹
    **(COR 1, LOE C-EO)**

* Treat patients with ECG findings consistent with ACS according to **STEMI or NSTE-ACS guidelines**¹,²
  **(COR 1, LOE C-EO)**

* In patients with intermediate-to-high suspicion for ACS and a nondiagnostic ECG, **posterior leads (V7–V9)** are reasonable to evaluate for posterior MI³–⁵
  **(COR 2a, LOE B-NR)**

---

### **2.3.3. Chest Radiography**

* Obtain a **chest radiograph** in acute chest pain to evaluate for alternative cardiac, pulmonary, or thoracic causes
  **(COR 1, LOE C-EO)**

---

## **2.3.4. Biomarkers**

* Serial **cardiac troponin (cTn)** measurements are useful to identify abnormal values and **rising or falling patterns** consistent with acute myocardial injury¹–²¹
  **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

* **High-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn)** is the **preferred biomarker** for acute chest pain because it improves detection and exclusion of myocardial injury and increases diagnostic accuracy¹,⁷,²¹–²⁶
  **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

* Clinicians should be familiar with the **99th percentile upper reference limit** for the specific cTn assay used at their institution²³,²⁶
  **(COR 1, LOE C-EO)**

* With availability of cTn, **CK-MB and myoglobin are not useful** for diagnosing acute myocardial injury²⁷–³²
  **(COR 3: No Benefit, LOE B-NR)**

---

## **4.1. Patients With Acute Chest Pain and Suspected ACS (Not Including STEMI)**

### **General Approach**

* Clinical decision pathways (CDPs) should be used to **stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups** to guide disposition and diagnostic evaluation¹–¹⁴
  **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

* When serial troponins are used to exclude myocardial injury, recommended repeat intervals are:

  * **1–3 hours** for hs-cTn
  * **3–6 hours** for conventional cTn assays¹⁶–¹⁷
    **(COR 1, LOE B-NR)**

* Institutions should implement **standardized CDPs** with troponin sampling protocols tailored to the specific assay in use¹⁸,¹⁹
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

* Prior cardiac testing results should be **reviewed and incorporated** into CDPs when available²⁰–²⁴
  **(COR 1, LOE C-LD)**

* In patients with:

  * Normal ECG
  * Symptoms suggestive of ACS beginning ≥3 hours before ED arrival
    A **single hs-cTn below the limit of detection** at time zero is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury¹,³²⁵–²⁹
    **(COR 2a, LOE B-NR)**

---

## **4.1.1. Low-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain**

* Patients with a **30-day risk of death or MACE <1%** should be designated as **low risk**¹¹
