ACC/AHA Chest Pain Guideline — Key Recommendations

##Defining Chest Pain
  Initial Triage (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
    Use early assessment of chest pain to triage patients based on likelihood of myocardial ischemia¹-⁷

##Terminology (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
  Avoid the term “atypical chest pain”
  Describe symptoms as:
    Cardiac
    Possibly cardiac
    Noncardiac
  Note: These terms are more specific and reduce misclassification¹-⁷

##Initial Evaluation
  History (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
    Obtain a focused history that includes:
    Symptom characteristics
      Symptom duration
      Associated features
      Cardiovascular risk factor

    Focus on the Uniqueness of Chest Pain in Women (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
      Women presenting with chest pain are at risk for underdiagnosis; cardiac causes should always be considered¹–⁷
      History in women should emphasize accompanying symptoms more common in ACS (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, nausea)¹–⁷ (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
    
    Considerations for Older Patients With Chest Pain (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
      In patients >75 years, consider ACS when chest pain is accompanied by:
        Shortness of breath
        Syncope
        Acute delirium
        Unexplained fall
    
    Considerations for Diverse Patient Populations (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
        Use cultural competency training to improve outcomes in patients from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds
        When English is not a patient’s primary language, use formal medical translation services to address language barriers
    
    Patient-Centric Considerations (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
        For acute chest pain, patients or bystanders should activate 9-1-1 to initiate EMS transport to the nearest ED
    
    Physical Examination (COR 1, LOE C-EO)
      Perform an initial focused cardiovascular examination to:
        Aid in diagnosis of ACS
        Identify other life-threatening causes (e.g., aortic dissection, PE, esophageal rupture)
        Detect complications

##Diagnostic Testing
  Setting Considerations
    If no clear noncardiac cause is evident, obtain an ECG for patients with stable chest pain seen in office settings; refer to the ED if ECG is unavailable¹-⁵ (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
    Patients with suspected ACS or other life-threatening causes in the office setting should be urgently transported to the ED, ideally by EMS¹-⁹ (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
    In all settings, obtain and review an ECG within 10 minutes of arrival for patients with acute chest pain¹,³,⁶,⁷,¹⁰ (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
    Measure cardiac troponin (cTn) as soon as possible after ED presentation in suspected ACS⁸,⁹ (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
    Avoid delayed ED transfer for patients with suspected ACS initially evaluated in outpatient settings when diagnostic testing (e.g., cTn) is required (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD)

  Electrocardiogram
    If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, perform serial ECGs to detect ischemic changes, especially when (COR 1, LOE C-EO) ¹:
      Clinical suspicion for ACS is high
      Symptoms persist
      Clinical status worsens

  Treat patients with ECG findings consistent with ACS according to STEMI or NSTE-ACS guidelines¹,² (COR 1, LOE C-EO)
    In patients with intermediate-to-high suspicion for ACS and a nondiagnostic ECG, posterior leads (V7–V9) are reasonable to evaluate for posterior MI³–⁵ (COR 2a, LOE B-NR)

  Chest Radiography (COR 1, LOE C-EO)
    Obtain a chest radiograph in acute chest pain to evaluate for alternative cardiac, pulmonary, or thoracic causes

  Biomarkers
    Serial cardiac troponin (cTn) measurements are useful to identify abnormal values and rising or falling patterns consistent with acute myocardial injury¹-²¹ (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
    High-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn) is the preferred biomarker for acute chest pain because it improves detection and exclusion of myocardial injury and increases diagnostic accuracy¹,⁷,²¹-²⁶        (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
    Clinicians should be familiar with the 99th percentile upper reference limit for the specific cTn assay used at their institution²³,²⁶ (COR 1, LOE C-EO)
    With availability of cTn, CK-MB and myoglobin are not useful for diagnosing acute myocardial injury²⁷-³² (COR 3, LOE B-NR)
  
##Patients With Acute Chest Pain and Suspected ACS (Not Including STEMI)
  General Approach
    Clinical decision pathways (CDPs) should be used to stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups to guide disposition and diagnostic evaluation¹-¹⁴ (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
    When serial troponins are used to exclude myocardial injury, recommended repeat intervals are (COR 1, LOE B-NR):
      1–3 hours for hs-cTn
      3–6 hours for conventional cTn assays¹⁶-¹⁷
    Institutions should implement standardized CDPs with troponin sampling protocols tailored to the specific assay in use¹⁸,¹⁹ (COR 1, LOE C-LD)
    Prior cardiac testing results should be reviewed and incorporated into CDPs when available²⁰-²⁴ (COR 1, LOE C-LD)

    In patients with:
      Normal ECG
      Symptoms suggestive of ACS beginning ≥3 hours before ED arrival
      A single hs-cTn below the limit of detection at time zero is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury¹,³,²⁵-²⁹ (COR 2a, LOE B-NR)

##Low-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain
  Patients with a 30-day risk of death or MACE <1% should be designated as low risk¹¹ (COR 1, LOE B-NR)
  For low-risk patients with suspected ACS (<1% 30-day risk), it is reasonable to discharge home without admission or urgent cardiac testing¹²-¹⁶ (COR 2a, LOE B-R)

##Intermediate-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain
  General Intermediate-Risk
  Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended as a rapid bedside test to (COR 1, LOE C-EO):
  Establish ventricular and valvular function
  Evaluate for wall motion abnormalities
  Assess for pericardial effusion
  Management in an observation unit is reasonable to reduce length of stay and cost compared with inpatient admission¹-⁷ (COR 2a, LOE A)

##Intermediate-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain and No Known CAD
  Index Diagnostic Testing
  Anatomic Testing
  CCTA is useful after a negative or inconclusive ACS evaluation to exclude atherosclerotic plaque and obstructive CAD¹-¹¹ (COR 1, LOE A)

##Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is recommended when (COR 1, LOE C-EO):
  Moderate–severe ischemia is present, or There is recent (<1 year) abnormal stress testing, and no known CAD by prior anatomic testing
  CCTA is reasonable in patients with previous mildly abnormal stress testing (<1 year) to diagnose obstructive CAD¹²,¹³ (COR 2a, LOE C-LD)

##Stress Testing
  Exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, stress PET/SPECT MPI, or stress CMR are useful to diagnose myocardial ischemia¹,⁴,¹⁰,¹⁴-³⁶ (COR 1, LOE B-NR)

##Sequential or Add-On Testing
  FFR-CT is useful for stenoses of 40%–90% on CCTA to diagnose vessel-specific ischemia and guide revascularization decisions³⁷-⁴³ (COR 2a, LOE B-NR)
  After inconclusive stress testing, CCTA is useful to exclude atherosclerotic plaque and obstructive CAD (COR 2a, LOE C-EO)
  After inconclusive CCTA, stress imaging (echo, PET/SPECT MPI, or CMR) can be useful to diagnose ischemia (COR 2a, LOE C-EO)
